# A terminal campaign tracker for "under falling skyes"

>We do these things not because they are easy, but because we thought they were going to be easy[cit.]

I'm creating a simple campaign tracker for Under Falling Sky, no rules from the game, only the randomization of the scenario and the digitalization of the campaign diary

This is an excuse to create my own [json library](https://github.com/Iximiel/json) and to try to use [FTXUI](https://github.com/ArthurSonzogni/FTXUI)
