# A terminal campaign tracker for "under falling skyes"

>We do these things not because they are easy, but because we thought they were going to be easy[cit.]

I'm creating a simple campaign tracker for Under Falling Sky, no rules from the game, only the
randomization of the scenario and the digitalization of the campaign diary.

Since I do not own the rights to the game, the `campaign.data` files contains anonymous cities,
scenarios and character names, so you have to open the  `campaign.data` file and edit in the names of your cities, characters and scenarios

This project was an excuse to create my own [json library](https://github.com/Iximiel/json) and to try to use [FTXUI](https://github.com/ArthurSonzogni/FTXUI)
